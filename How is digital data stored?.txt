Computers store information in base 2, also known as binary. This means that every bit of information on your computer, from the code used to run the app you’re using
to read this, to the files in your “homework” folder, can be broken down into a seemingly endless string of 0s and 1s. A good example of this is the alphabet. There
are many ways to store letters of the alphabet, but one of the simplest methods is called ASCII. With ASCII, computers don’t really see letters as letters; 
instead, letters are stored based on their numeric value, with A being equivalent to 1, B to 2, and so on. This seems pretty simple on its own, but remember that
 computers store information in binary, so the “1” is actually 00000001, the “2” is actually 00000010, etc. There are a variety of methods used to store binary
information, but most computers either use a hard disk drive (HDD) or solid state drive (SSD). Due to the binary nature of computers, all forms of digital storage
rely on binary forms of data storage. To understand this concept with an analogy, imagine taking a standardized test with four multiple choice questions that each
have four possible answers (A, B, C, or D). If you answer B to question 1, you could represent that as 0100. In other words, A is not filled in, B is filled in,
C is not, and D is not. Using this system, if a student answered A, B, C, D in that order, you could represent that as 1000 0100 0010 0001 (without the spaces).
